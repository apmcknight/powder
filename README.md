**🤓 Project Background:** CSS Art is the utilization of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to create complex, and often times stunning art pieces—solely in code.  

**🔍 Project Overview:** Following the projects assignment, I began searching creative social-media sites like Dribbble, Bechance, and GitHub to see what others’ have created. Using this knowledge, I began brainstorming of my own dissipate, and unique ideas for solving a creative problem.

**🚧 The Problem:** How can a (relatively) boring project, like CSS Art Icons—become more that can standout?

**👍🏻The Solution:** **powder.** Powder is the answer to the problem. Using Weather Icons created using SVGs, along with shapes and unique elements built in CSS; I was able to create something more than the average website.
